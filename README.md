# sorting_algorithms Project

This sorting_algorithms project was done to illustrate our understanding on the implementation of different sorting algorithms, while checking their various wors-cases in the time-space tradeoffs.

We have implemented bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and quick sort.
